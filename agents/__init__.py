"""
Agent modules for orchestrating data pipeline tasks.

INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:
Agents are higher-level orchestrators that coordinate multiple operations.
They use the core modules to accomplish complex tasks.

Agent Pattern Benefits:
1. Separation of Concerns: Agents handle workflow, core handles logic
2. Testability: Can test agents independently
3. Flexibility: Can swap out core implementations
4. Reusability: Same core logic, different agent workflows
