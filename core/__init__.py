"""
Core business logic modules.

INTERVIEW EXPLANATION:
The 'core' package contains the main business logic, separate from:
- Agents (orchestration layer)
- Utils (helper functions)
- Config (configuration)

This separation follows the "Separation of Concerns" principle:
- Core: What the system does (business logic)
- Agents: How it's orchestrated (workflow)
- Utils: Supporting functions (helpers)
